plone-active-reolad
===================

Uses plone reload as soon as a file is changed in the monitored folder.
<br/>
edit the plone-active-reload.py script for configuration.
<br/>
It would be nice if it got a config file and a better system arguments handling, but it works nicely as soon as it's configured.
<br/>
Perfect for plone development.
